    <p>Their job is very essential for our civilization.</p>

            <h2>Did you hear about Bay of Biscay??</h2>
            <p> One of the most dagerous places I have ever visited before is Bay of Biscay.</p>
            <p> It`s always dangerous due to it`s geographycal location and geology.</p>
            <p> Bay of Biscay is symbollical place for me. I had my second birthday at that place on march 2009, when my vessel was fighting with severe storm.</p>
